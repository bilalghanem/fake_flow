3774,"Obama’s attorney general Eric Holder recently told Rachel Maddow that he won’t rule out running for office in the future. What will his campaign slogan be, Nation of Cowards?

The Washington Free Beacon reports:

Holder Doesn’t Rule Out Running for Political Office in the Future

Maddow asked Holder, who served during the Obama administration, whether he was ever going to run for political office during his first live television interview since President Donald Trump was sworn into office.

“I don’t know. You know, I’m focused on this National Democratic Redistricting Committee. That’s the focus of all my political activities at this point,” Holder said. “I want to make sure we repel these attacks on our democracy, try to end political gerrymandering to the extent that we can.”

He went on to say he will see about future opportunities and that he will not say “no” about potentially running in the future. He added that future political ambitions are not what his main focus is right now.

“You’re not working on the redistricting project because it’s part of a larger project in terms of you getting back into political life and then electorally?” Maddow asked.

“No. I’m not being hyperbolic here. I think our democracy is under attack, if you look at gerrymandering in the way in which we have a system where politicians are picking their voters as opposed to citizens picking their representatives,” Holder said.

Well, the man is ready to shock the world with the grand plans of the actual wedding celebrations, wherein his daughter Brahmini will tie the knot with Andhra Pradesh-based industrialist’s son on November 16.
Believe it or not, the man is reportedly spending nearly Rs 500 crore on the wedding, and how!
According to media reports, sets of Vijayanagara Palace of Krishnadevaraya has been recreated, the mandappam is a rip-off of the Vijaya Vittala temple in Hampi, priests from Tirupati Thirumala temple have been called upon to perform the rituals. Not just that, he has also recreated his childhood home so he can hand over his daughter to the groom in the same house. According to reports, Bollywood biggies like Shah Rukh Khan and Prabhu Deva are expected to perform on the occasion, along with famous Tollywood stars.

What makes it absolutely bizarre is the fact that this wedding comes at a time when the country is struggling to withdraw mere Rs 4,500 from their accounts after Prime Minister Modi’s demonetisation move, rendering past notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 invalid.
The former BJP minister and mining baron, Reddy, was arrested in 2012 in connection with cases of corruption and illegal mining and released on bail last year. Reportedly, the Income-Tax Department is keeping a close watch on Reddy for all his transactions during the wedding to source flow of funds.

9116,"If you’re on the fence about getting a tattoo, here’s one more horrifying risk to consider when making your very permanent decision. Please protect your children and young adults. Every parent needs to read this.

Today, tattoos are more popular than ever. As WebMD reports: “Nearly 30% of Americans have at least 1 tattoo, and those with 1 rarely stop there. Almost 70% of them have 2 or more.”

Tattoo shop regulations can vary from state to state and even town to town. While some communities may not have any restrictions at all. Minors, for example, can legally get tattoos in five states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho and Kansas).

With tattoo shops seemingly on every corner, doctors have long-warned of the scary risks associated with getting a tattoo. But what most young adults fail to consider are the countless dangers that come before — and after — making the decision to permanently ink their skin.

Last week, an unnamed young man reportedly endured a tragic death just five short days after getting a religious tattoo on his calf. (Warning: This article contains graphic images.)

The deceased man’s tragic story began after he received a new tattoo and reportedly ignored the tattoo artist’s advice to wait at least two weeks before submerging it in any swimming pool or seawater.

Shortly after enjoying a swim in the Gulf of Mexico, the man developed a fever and chills. As reported in the British Medical Journal Case Reports, the man had become infected with Vibrio vulnificus, a dangerous pathogen that is present in swimming pools and coastal areas. Wounds infected by the deadly bacteria have a mortality rate of approximately 25 percent.

Two days after the man ignored the critical advice, a rash began to form around his tattoo and the symptoms became worse. The dying young man was rushed to the hospital. But by the time he was under medical care, his leg had turned purple. His right calf, where the tattoo was, quickly developed deep wounds due to the infection.

The man was on life support and battling septic shock and cellulitis — an infection of the deeper layers of skin and the underlying tissue. His immune system was overtaken by the infection and his organs were struggling to function. Although the man’s condition improved after a few weeks, the damage to his body was so severe that he passed away after two months in the intensive care unit.

Now, the young man’s grieving family hopes others will learn from his deadly decision to ignore expert advise after getting a tattoo.

Watch the full report in the video below:

Tattoo artists should urge people to wait for at least two weeks before submerging the healing area in water. Experts warn that submerging open sores such as tattoos in water– whether a pool, bath or seawater — poses a threat of infection.

With the summer months upon us, countless young adults will contemplate getting a tattoo while vacationing with friends. Please warn your family of the many dangers associated with tattoos and share this young man’s tragic story — by doing so you may safe a life!

1678,"

Roanoke, Va.–A Roanoke man savagely mutilated himself Friday while trying to prove to his ex-wife he was “still man enough to sexual role-play and use a skill saw naked.” Sources say he was attempting to sacrifice the family housecat to the love gods when things suddenly appeared very wrong.

Tina Shrubman, a 46 year old “homemaker” described the scene to police and reporters a “bloodbath, not in the sexual way, but almost,” as the man’s dismembered tool flopped around like a suffocating fish on the counter-top in her Martha Stewart-influenced kitchen. Lustily, Shrubman bit her lower lip.

Lieutenant Leroy Jackson, who is not supposed to disclose any details around an ongoing investigation, revealed to reporters, “Cletus Ragburn, waited for Ms. Shrubman’s return in her living room, naked, prepared to operate a table saw mounted on two sawhorses. Confused, she instinctively pepper-sprayed him, causing his thumb to react, triggering the power saw to spin out of control and fall to the floor, castrating him in the process.”

When asked where the pet would be sent for treatment, Jackson replied, “I am not at liberty to divulge that information.”

Joe Diamond, attorney for Ragburn’s johnson revealed that the member was seeking severance pay, a full health insurance package and a guaranteed nine-to-five stroke job.",1,training

The hedge fund exited its position in rental-car company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HRI, +0.24% in the quarter, selling 3.3 million shares valued at roughly $36.5 million. That moved proved timely as Hertz shares plunged last week in the wake of disappointing financial results and a lowered outlook for the year.
Meanwhile, Greenlight acquired 3.09 million shares of U.S. Steel X, +8.05% , valued at roughly $58.3 million as of Sept. 30. Though U.S. Steel recently lowered its outlook for 2016, its shares have surged this year.

CARDIAC FLOOR – Reports around the hospital are the nurse’s candy drawer on the cardiac floor has run cold.

“You mean to tell me I started rounds on the 7th floor only to have the drawer picked over?” Dr. Helms was heard asking. ““Seriously after banana, chocolate Laffy Taffy is the worst kind, and it has the worst jokes!”

This was verified by a third party, his “joke” read: What kind of candy gets the giggles? Laffy Taffy.

“Oh, give me a break! They don’t even try on the crap flavors. The green joke would have been epic,” he said as if his day was ruined.

Dum Dum Suckers are no consolation prize. Leroy, a respiratory therapist, was overheard telling the nurses, “Dum Dums, dip some paper in sugar because that is what they are. In 2 seconds I’ll be chewing on that paper stick gagging more than the COPD guy in room 7.”

“You might as well have a bowl full of lemon drops and lightly colored mints!” another physician complained. “Did someone raid grandma’s candy dish? Where are the peppermint-striped candies?” said the doctor with sarcasm dripping from his comments, who also hasn’t donated any candy to the drawer in over three years.

“I’d even take a Werther’s Original right now,” stated a medical student who has never contributed to the candy drawer. He continues to mooch nonetheless from the nurses’ candy drawer just for simple daily caloric intake.

The hospital is a mess now, everyone but the 7th floor nurses that is…

Operation “Second Drawer,” also known as the plan to hide the “good candy” in the next drawer below has been a success. The drawer is labeled as “The Joint Commission Updates” which includes Snickers, Hershey bars, and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. Overall morale at the telemetry nurses station is high.

NEW YORK -- Utah's Gordon Hayward made a triumphant NBA return from a fractured finger Sunday by scoring 28 points to lead the Utah Jazz over the host New York Knicks 114-109. 
The 26-year-old forward missed the first six games of the season with a broken left ring finger but Hayward, who led Utah last season with 19.7 points and 3.7 assists a game, made the most of his season debut in a Madison Square Garden matinee. READ: McCollum matches career-high, Blazers beat Grizzlies 
""First off, it felt great just to be out there,"" Hayward said. ""You work all summer to be able to play, and so to have the injury was definitely unfortunate, but it's good to be out there with the guys. 
""It's a little awkward playing with the splint for sure, but it's not going to stop me from getting out there on the court when it's time to play."" 
Rodney Hood scored 12 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter as the Jazz (4-3) outscored New York 36-29 in the last 12 minutes. 
George Hill added 23 points and nine assists for Utah while Frenchman Rudy Gobert scored 13 points and grabbed eight rebounds and Derrick Favors scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds. 
""It gives us another guy who can demand double-teams and can create,"" Hill said of Hayward's return. ""It just gives a whole other dimension."" 
Carmelo Anthony had 28 points and nine rebounds for the Knicks (2-4) while Kristaps Porzingis scored 28 points and grabbed eight rebounds for New York.

MANILA – It’s only been a week since Kylie Verzosa was crowned Miss International 2016, but the Filipina beauty queen’s schedule has already been packed with activities. 
On Wednesday, Verzosa visited the Japan office of UNICEF, stressing that the “developmental stages of a child are important.” 
She also had a roundtable discussion with the directors of UNICEF Japan and Denmark on maternal and child health. 
“The girls and I cannot wait to get back home to help our own UNICEF field offices,” she said. “There is so much that can be done. Together, we can help more.” Nov 2, 2016 at 7:33pm PDT A photo posted by Kylie Verzosa (@kylieverzosa) on Nov 2, 2016 at 5:33am PDT 
Prior to this, Verzosa visited the Ise Shrine and the city of Toba. She also joined the panel of a women’s entrepreneurship forum and picked pearls from cultivated oysters. 
“Just like a person, it takes time and pressure to cultivate a perfect pearl, over two years! The same amount of time (and pressure) I spent training for Miss International,” she wrote in an Instagram post. 
On top of these, Verzosa was also able to squeeze in an interview with ABS-CBN’s Korina Sanchez for the magazine show “Rated K,” and visit students from beauty schools. 
Verzosa was proclaimed Miss International 2016 in Tokyo, Japan last October 27. She is the sixth Filipina to win the crown.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Jaccob Slavin scored the only goal of the shootout to lead the Carolina Hurricanes to a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators on Saturday night.
Jeff Skinner and Ron Hainsey scored in regulation for Carolina, which ended a two-game losing streak. Cam Ward finished with 25 saves through overtime and denied all three Nashville attempts in the shootout.
James Neal and Matt Irwin had the goals for the Predators, losers of two consecutive games — both in shootouts. Pekka Rinne stopped 23 shots.
Irwin put Nashville ahead 2-1 with 2:55 left in the second as his shot from the left point through traffic beat Ward on the stick side. It gave Irwin a goal in three straight games, matching a career high.
Hainsey tied it at 8:22 of the third on a short-handed score, taking a pass from Elias Lindholm and driving to the net and slipping the puck between Rinne's pads.

5606,"One thing is for sure- Any leaker who is sharing classified, sensitive information in public is committing treason! This level of corruption has to be taken down very carefully with utmost wisdom and the persons who are committing this should go to prison for the remainder of their lives!

On Thursday White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci suggested that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus is sharing confidential information to the press. Scaramucci said he was contacting the FBI after a Politico report on his financial disclosures — which were publicly available — and mysteriously tagged Priebus at the end of the tweet. As news outlets began to wonder if Scaramucci was targeting Priebus, Scaramucci deleted the tweet and explained, “Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks.”

However, Kellyanne Conway did not deny that Reince Priebus is one of the major White House leakers after Anthony Scaramucci seemed to call him out on Twitter.

When Fox News host Steve Doocy asked Conway Thursday morning is Reince Priebus the big leaker, because that’s what it looks like in that particular tweet Scaramucci sent out yesterday, Kellyanne Conway did not deny or confirm anything.

Doocy added: “According to the National Journal, apparently Mr. Scaramucci did report Reince to the FBI.”

“I’m not aware of the latter. I will say that leakers are easier to figure out than they may think. This West Wing is a very small place. And I will say, for me, I am the jerk that hired a chief of staff because I thought we were supposed to work on policy not three press or comms assistants,” Conway said of Scaramucci reporting Priebus.

This President said all during the campaign…if you are dishonest and don’t do your job effectively you will be called out and or fired….that’s how his businesses ran to success and now he is doing effectively the same to have our government run the same. It is about time to reveal the truth!

What is your opinion, is Reince Priebus leaker?",1,training
6519,"US President Obama: World leaders must heed people’s economic fears US President Obama: World leaders must heed people’s economic fears Obama said that both Trump's election and the British vote to leave the European Union reflected the need to deal with ""people's fears that their children won't do as well as they have.'' Published:November 16, 2016 12:20 am President Barack Obama (AP Photo) 
Drawing a broad lesson from the election of Donald Trump, President Barack Obama said Tuesday that world leaders need to pay attention to people’s very real fears of economic dislocation and inequality in the midst of globalization. “The more aggressively and effectively we deal with those issues, the less those fears may channel themselves into counterproductive approaches that can pit people against each other,” Obama said as he opened the last foreign tour of his presidency. 
Watch What Else Is Making News 
Obama, in a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, said that both Trump’s election and the British vote to leave the European Union reflected the need to deal with “people’s fears that their children won’t do as well as they have.” 
“Sometimes people just feel as if we want to try something and see if we can shake things up,” Obama said. 
The president seemed skeptical that “the new prescriptions being offered” would satisfy the frustrations and anger evident in election. And he played a bit of defense, saying that his agenda over past eight years had dealt with economic issues head on and “the country’s indisputably better off.” 
Obama added pointedly that some of the rhetoric seen in the elections was “pretty troubling and not necessarily connected to the facts.” 
Tsipras, for his part, said he had refrained from rushing to criticizing Trump as some other European leaders had done, saying that the Republican’s “aggressive manner” as a candidate might be different as president. He predicted that “in the near future not much is going to change in the relations between the EU, Greece and the United States of America.” 
Tsipras added that it was one thing to criticize Trump during the campaign and another thing now Trump will be a “major player” in the world. 
Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos played host at an official dinner for Obama at the presidential mansion in the evening. 
Obama’s visit sparked minor clashes in Athens as left-wing demonstrators tried to break a police cordon and were repelled with tear gas. No injuries or arrests were reported. About 3,000 anarchists, left-wing group supporters and students marched through the city center in a demonstration originally planned to reach the U.S. Embassy in another part of town. 
All demonstrations have been banned in a large swath of central Athens during Obama’s two-day visit. Riot police blocked the marchers from the part of the city where Obama will be, parking buses across roads and manning cordons. More than 5,000 police were deployed in the capital’s streets. 
The last sitting president to visit Greece was Bill Clinton in 1999. His visit, during the height of U.S. intervention in the wars ensuing from the breakup of Yugoslavia, was marked with extensive violent demonstrations. 
The president earlier offered the Greeks reassuring words about the U.S. commitment to NATO, saying Democratic and Republican administrations alike recognize the importance of the alliance to the trans-Atlantic relationship. 
Obama told Pavlopoulos that a strong NATO is of “utmost importance” and would provide “significant continuity even as we see a transition in government in the United States.” 
Pavlopoulos, for his part, thanked Obama for U.S. support of the Greek people in a time of social and economic crisis, and said he was confident that Trump “will continue on the same path.” 
Trump’s election has generated significant unease in Europe because of his tough talk during the campaign suggesting the U.S. might pull out of the NATO alliance if other countries don’t pay more. 
Obama’s reassurances reflect an attempt to ease the deep concerns about Trump and the future of America’s treaty alliances. Yet they may be greeted with skepticism: For months throughout the campaign, Obama repeatedly assured world leaders in public and private that Trump would not be elected, only to see him emerge victorious from last week’s election. 
In his meeting with Tsipras, Obama offered a welcome message of support for the Greeks as they struggle with both economic woes and a huge influx of refugees. Obama pledged to keep pressing his view that “austerity alone cannot deliver prosperity and that it is going to be important both with respect to debt relief and other accommodative strategies to help the Greek people in this period of adjustment.” 
On Wednesday, he is scheduled to tour the Acropolis and give a major speech about democracy and globalization before flying on to Berlin. From Germany, Obama will travel to Peru for an Asian economic summit before returning to Washington on Saturday. 
Obama said he was looking forward to visiting the Acropolis because “if you come to Greece you’ve got to do a little bit of sightseeing.” Best of Express",0,training
9619,"A drenched orange kitty aptly named Thomas Jefferson (Photo: Nashville Fire Department) 
NASHVILLE — A soaked but fittingly named cat called Thomas Jefferson was rescued on Election Day from a city drain pipe.
Just after 1 p.m. CT, Nashville Fire Department crews responded to a luxury condominium complex after a neighbor heard crying from inside a pipe. Firefighters found a a wet, miserable orange cat stuck and meowing in an underground pipe, fire department spokesman Brian Haas said.
Firefighters discovered that he had climbed into a third-story rain gutter on the condo, fell three stories inside the gutter and got lodged in under ground in the drain pipe.
""The end of the drain pipe was a bit crushed so the cat couldn't get out,"" Haas said. ""We had to go in and dig the pipe out so we could get the cat out.""
In about 20 minutes, firefighters freed the Thomas Jefferson, he said. Earlier in the day firefighters were dispatched to find a parrot in a tree, but were less successful in corralling the bird.

Hello, kitty! Duchess Kate meets Bob the movie-star cat
A neighbor told firefighters that the ginger cat may have been stuck in the pipe since 6 a.m. He said he didn’t realize it was stuck until he heard the crying in early afternoon.
The cat belongs to Joseph Kline, president of Watkins College of Art, Design & Film in Nashville.
Kline's first words to his cat after the rescue: “What were you thinking?”
The cat, which firefighters dubbed #DRAINPIPEKITTY on Twitter, is expected to dry out and be fine.

Updated: November 15, 2016 2:58 am Supermoon. (File Photo) 
Skygazers took to high-rise buildings, observatories and beaches today to get a glimpse of the closest “supermoon” to Earth in almost seven decades, and snap dramatic pictures. The unusually big and bright moon appeared at its most impressive as night fell over Asia, but astronomy enthusiasts will be able to see Earth’s satellite loom large anywhere i the world shortly after sunset. The phenomenon happens when the moon is full at the same time as, or very near, perigee — its closest point to Earth on an elliptical, monthly orbit. It was the closest to Earth since 1948 at a distance of 356,509 kilometres, creating what NASA described as “an extra-supermoon”. 
Watch What Else Is Making News 
Skygazers and photographers headed to the best viewing spots in Asia, where the phenomenon was visible first, hoping that cloudy skies and the perennial pollution that blight many of the region’s cities would not spoil the fun. The eastern Sydney suburb of Bronte became an unexpected viewing spot as thousands of people armed with picnic mats an cameras packed its small beach near Bondi to catch a glimpse of the supermoon after a Facebook invite went viral. Loud cheers went up among the crowd as the moon made brief appearances between heavy, grey clouds before disappearing 
“It’s really nice,” Aidan Millar-Powell told AFP of the festive, community atmosphere at the beach. “People don’t usually come together like this in Sydney for a natural phenomenon.” The supermoon was visible across much of India although residents of New Delhi, the world’s most polluted capital, struggled to see it clearly through the toxic smog that has been shrouding the city in recent weeks 
Tourists, office workers and couples crowded the Hong Kong waterfront as the supersized moon rose over the skyscrapers of the financial hub, while further north in the Chinese capital Beijing the moon climbed spectacularly over the city’s skyline. “I’ve never seen a moon this big,” said Lee Pak-kan, 44, who was watching at the Hong Kong waterfront. “The moon is quite orange too… it’s quite special. 
In the Taiwanese capital Taipei, more than 100 people queued up to get a look at the spectacle through telescopes outside a major public hall, while others flocked to the city’s landmark Taipei 101 skyscraper — one of the world’s tallest buildings — to witness the supermoon. “It’s quite moving, to see it up close. It’s so big, so round, so bright,” said Julia Lee, who was peering through a telescope outside the hall 
Meanwhile, professional astronomers were at the ready at observatories across the region to explain the phenomenon to curious members of the public. In Thailand, astrologers were variously predicting the supermoon would bring disaster or great fortune.",0,training
10985,"It’s about time that The Pokemon Company Nintendo , and Game Freak have revealed the final starter evolutions for the game; because really, that’s what we all want to know before we buy the games. Let’s all be real for a moment and just admit to ourselves that none of the starters were what we wanted them to turn out! None of them.

Allow me to start by saying that I personally think that The Pokemon Company took a page straight out of the 1980’s and modeled Incineroar after a Thundercat! C’mon, admit it! You all (at least those of you who remember the Thundercats) thought of the Thundercats as soon as you saw Incineroar! Just look at it!

Secondly, I think we all know why Popplio’s final evolution, Primarina, was so feminine looking.

I believe that it is truly to get female gamers into the Pokemon games.

It looks pretty alright. I really don’t have a problem with strictly female looking Pokemon, but I know some people will and start a HUGE argument over it and make a massive fuss about it and so on… People, they aren’t even real creatures.

And finally, Decidueye, the final evolution of Rowlet. This is a massively tall, archer owl with a hoodie head complete with draw strings.

Can I just say how disappointed I am in this particular evolution? This little round owl had so much potential and Nintendo ruined it with this final evolution. I’m not sure what they were thinking but, oh my goodness they must have had some bad Ramen bowls or something. They could’ve done better in my opinion.",1,training

Share Indiana Pacers guard Glenn Robinson III (40) is fouled by Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green (23) in the second half of the game at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Photo by Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports/Reuters 
INDIANAPOLIS -- Glenn Robinson usually plays in the shadow of superstar teammate Paul George. 
But the 22-year-old has spent too much time this season sitting on the Indiana Pacers' bench to let this opportunity go to waste. 
Robinson played in place of injured George for the second-straight game and scored 17 points to lead the Pacers to a 91-70 win over the second place Los Angeles Clippers. 
George has been sidelined with a left ankle injury and a sore back. READ: Wizards’ Beal fined for grabbing throat of Magic’s Fournier 
""We have shown that when we don't have our best player, it is a must for the rest of us to come together,"" said Pacers Al Jefferson. 
That's exactly what happened Sunday night as Myles Turner also scored 17 points and the Pacers' defense shut down the high-flying Clippers. The 70 points was the fewest by the Clippers in coach Doc Rivers' four seasons there. 
The previous low was 80, and the previous low this season was 83. 
Indiana won its second in a row, also getting 16 points from Jefferson, while Rodney Stuckey had 12 and Thaddeus Young had 11. 
""We protected the paint and showed a wall on defense,"" said Jefferson, who added eight rebounds. 
The Clippers lost their second contest in a row on their six-game road trip. They got 16 points from Blake Griffin, 13 from Chris Paul and 12 from Jamal Crawford. The Clippers shot only 31.4 percent overall, including four-of-24 from three-point range. 
The Clippers' starting five combined for only 47 points and shot 34.2 percent. 
""So far, we would play a good game, and then I would not recognize our team the next night,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. 
""I don't want us to take steps backward after we win a game, and tonight we outhustled them and forced a good team into 20 turnovers.""

1418,"The small apartment on Washington’s Batt Street served as a temporary office for Judge Harry P. Schuter, 62, who had been specially selected by federal investigators to officiate the case of accused sex-crime perpetrator and pimp to dozens of secret famous figures Jeffrey Epstein. Today, it’s a scene of police tape, CSI investigators, and a family left mourning. Schuter’s body was found this morning by a cleaning lady.

Preliminary police theory is that the judge committed suicide by firearm, although the cleaner, Alice Frumpkin, tells a different story :

“There was eh…otra persona…other person who come to door. Wear hat. Blue pantsuit. Si. I no see face, but after, very loud BANG BANG! I tell policia, but they say maybe I buracho. Drunk. I no buracho. Only little bit.”

Police on the scene refused questions about the witness and a few others hearing two gunshots, dismissing them as “uninformed teabagger nonsense.”

MANILA – Sharon Cuneta had three actors on top of her mind when asked who she wants to work with in her future projects. 
In a video uploaded on her YouTube channel, Cuneta said she would love to do a movie with Kapamilya actors Coco Martin, John Lloyd Cruz and Daniel Padilla. 
She also mentioned about wanting to work with Liza Soberano, James Reid and Nadine Lustre. A photo posted by Sharon (@reallysharoncuneta) on Nov 11, 2016 at 2:19am PST 
“Yung mga bata [gusto ko makatrabaho]. Kasi iba ang dating sa screen ngayon kapag kasama ako from the last generation and 'yung mga taga henerasyon ngayon. Medyo exciting 'yung ganun. Pero ako si Coco talaga and si John Lloyd and si Daniel. They are very good actors,” she said. 
Cuneta, however, stressed that she accepts a project primarily because of its story and the message it conveys -- and not her co-actors. 
“It will always be the story that will determine kung gagawin mo ba or hindi. Hindi lagi 'yung kung sino ba ang kasama niya. Kahit kasama ko si Gabby (Concepcion) sa pelikula or si Richard (Gomez) or si Robin (Padilla), tapos ang pangit naman ng storya, walang pupuntahan. It will always depend on the story so I am waiting for something like ‘Madrasta’ to jump up at my face again,” she said. 
Meanwhile, Cuneta also shared that there are no plans in the near future for her to collaborate with her daughters KC and Frankie. 
“At this point, wala pa. I’m letting them go muna on their own. I think it’s hard enough to be the shadow of parents who are medyo not anonymous, medyo kilala. To be in the shadow of their mom or their respective dads, kawawa naman yung mga bata kasi mahahati yung atensyon,” she said. 
Cuneta revealed that she doesn’t think Frankie would want to go full time in show business. 
As for doing a project with KC, she said: “I think she has established herself, her name, has done very well. Baka mauna si KC at ako kung sakali man but it’s not really a priority at this point kasi masyadong too close to home. Maybe someday pa.”

3754,"Over the weekend, CBS reported that Judge Roy Moore now has a commanding lead over Doug Jones, his Democrat opponent, and a huge majority of Alabama Republicans believe the allegations against him are untrue. Moreover, many of those Republicans believe the allegations were created by Democrats and their media allies.

According to CBS:

The poll found 92 percent of Republicans who don’t believe the allegations against Moore say the Democrats are behind the charges, and 88 percent say newspapers and the media are behind them.

Multiple women have come forward to accuse Moore of inappropriately pursuing or touching them when they were teenagers. The youngest woman to accuse Moore says she was 14 and he was 32 at the time.

The Senate contest looks to be highly dependent on turnout. Moore has a lead over Democrat Doug Jones, 49 percent to 43 percent, among the likely voters who are most apt to vote on Dec. 12. Among all registered voters, the contest is even. And nearly a quarter of voters still describe themselves as “maybe” or “probably” going to vote.

Breitbart added:

Whether the allegations are true or not, the survey’s respondents were asked if what Moore is accused of is serious — and 82 percent said it was, while 18 percent said it was not serious. Twenty-one percent said the allegations do not concern them and 52 percent said the allegations concern them but “other things matter more,” while just 27 percent said the allegations were the “top concern” in the race.

Likely voters who do not believe the allegations said that they believe a combination of forces — including newspapers and the media, Democrats, other Republicans, and “people seeking attention or money” — are “behind” the allegations against Moore. Eighty-nine percent said that newspaper and the media are behind them, while only 11 percent said they were not behind them. When asked if Democrats were behind the allegations, 91 percent said yes and only 9 percent said no — while 51 percent believe other Republicans were behind them and 49 percent do not. When it comes to “people seeking attention or money,” 93 percent believe they are behind the allegations and only seven percent do not.

Stunningly, as well, another detail in the poll finds that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s original opposition to Moore—and his calls for Moore to “step aside” — only helped Moore solidify more support in the wake of the allegations. A whopping 30 percent of likely voters said that McConnell’s call for Moore to step aside in the wake of the allegations said it made them more likely to back Moore, while just six percent said it made them less likely to back Moore. Sixty-four percent of likely voters say that McConnell’s call for Moore to step aside does not matter in their voting decision.

“This poll is further proof that Mitch McConnell has zero sway or influence over Republican voters,” said Andy Surabian, a senior adviser to the Great America Alliance and an ex-White House aide who worked as a deputy for then-Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon. “Never has a party leader been so universally disliked by the very voters he’s supposed to represent.”

The special election is set for December 12.

9695,"Washington DC – President Trump addressed the country last night about the need for a border wall with Mexico. He made what many consider to be an awkward attempt to make his case to the American people. His presentation was stilted, wooden, and had none of the unhinged flair Trump’s supporters have come to expect.

They did not need to wait for long before Trump reverted back to form.

Americans Against Chinese Restaurants

Within minutes of ending his border wall appeal, the commander-in-chief took to Twitter to talk about the trade war with China. Not only did he call for more tariffs, but he urged Americans to boycott Chinese restaurants.

China is taking us to the cleaners. Every dollar we give them enables this tragedy to go on. We are in a crisis. Americans need to stop ordering take out from Chinese restaurants. When eating in these places we need to stand up and walk out without paying the bill. #MAGA

President Trump continued to tweet he understood Americans are going to feel the pain from the embargo of Chinese restaurants, but we all need to stand firm:

This is going to be tough. We can do it. Look, I’m suffering, too. I love pu-pu platters. It’s my favorite ethnic food. And General Gau makes a mean chicken. So crispy and saucy. He’s a great man. I’m making him Secretary of Defense and Delicious Chicken.

Republican senators are lining up behind Trump and his Chinese restaurant boycott. One senator experimented with making a pu-pu platter out of Chicken McNuggets, French fries, and sweet sauce. Inside sources say the procedure to pump his stomach went well and he should be out of hospital shortly.

3465,"Scott Ott first described him thus... a brave, thoughtful, serious man doing a brave, thoughtful serious job. In his latest FIREWALL, Bill Whittle provides the amazing and disturbing contrast between The President of the United States and The Leader of the Free World. See the transcript and video below:

TRANSCRIPT:

THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD

He’s the Leader of the Free World, elected by a civilized nation: militarily powerful because of, and not in spite of, it’s cultural commitment to science and art and medicine.

Although he spent much of his early life overseas, the Leader of the Free World grew up in the Northeast, and graduated from Harvard University. That he has a deep and abiding love for America is self-evident: he admires our energy, our inventiveness; our decency and kindness; our innate friendliness and charity. He loves our culture; he admires our private sector which generates so much innovation. And the Leader of the Free World admires and respects our vast military power, and the restraint which it is used – to him, it is indeed the Arsenal of Democracy.

And even though he has grown up the victim of bigotry and hatred, the Leader of the Free World loves America, even though slurs are applied to him still today. In spite of all that, he loves everything she stands for.

And there he stood, backed by American flags and framed in American glory – on the floor of the House of Representatives; where his predecessors made the case to fight against the great evils in the world: slavery. Nazism. Japanese Imperialism. Communism.

There he stood: The Leader of the Free World; a thoughtful, serious man making a thoughtful, serious case to the World’s Greatest deliberative body. The Leader of the Free World spoke frankly of the need to confront today, as we have confronted in the past, this latest threat to freedom, and science, and medicine, and art, and the basic human rights not only of women, and homosexuals but of everyone to live their own lives as they saw fit. He spoke against the clear and present danger posed by Islamic savages, motivated by religious hatred, implacable in their desire to see the world burn – and especially about the threat posed by the stat of Iran, which is working feverishly, night and day, so see those fires burn not at hundred but rather at thousands of degrees.

The President of the United States declined to attend this speech by the Leader of the Free World, because the President of the United States has called the Leader of the Free World “chickenshit.”

One of them is, anyway. Which one, I wonder?

You know, the internet has a wisdom all its own. Taking a snapshot of both these men in their youth, someone wrote:

Obama smoked Ganja; Netanyahu smoked terrorists.

Just a casual read of Dreams From My Father – and how it was written – show the President of the United States to have been a lazy, boastful, vain, disrespectful, sullen, pot-smoking narcissist who played basketball at the most exclusive private school in Hawaii, got high kicking back on the beach, and repeatedly blew off his book deadline after having spent the huge advance money. His brother, Mark Obama Neh-Des-AND-jo, lived in obscurity and utter poverty in Kenya, utterly ignored and unaided by his brother, The President of the United States of America.

Bibi Netanyahu was described by his teachers as courteous, polite, helpful, responsible, punctual, friendly, disciplined, cheerful, brave, active and obedient. After growing up in Pennsylvania, The Leader of the Free World returned to Israel, joined the IDF as a Special Forces commando, was part of the team that rescued the hostages aboard Sabena flight 571 – during which he was shot in the shoulder – then went back and fought along the Suez Canal in the Yom Kippur war before returning to America to get his degrees from both Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. HIS brother, Yonatan Netanyahu, was the only Israeli commando killed during the rescue of 100 Israeli hostages in the Raid on Entebbe on July 4th, 1976.

THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD – you know, the chickenshit one -- rescues his people when they are held hostage – PERSONALLY rescues them – and stands arm in arm with world leaders against the endless, savage, Islamic murders of Jews and all civilized people.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES goes golfing while hostages are being murdered – PERSONALLY goes golfing – and will not so much say the words “Islamic Terrorists” or “Jews” as our time for chickenshit posturing and preening runs out as fast as the nuclear centrifuges spinning in Iran.

8418,"Tune into country’s women pakhawaj players at fest in Pune Tune into country’s women pakhawaj players at fest in Pune The musician said that for many years, it was a popular belief that the Dhrupad style of singing was meant only for male singers. Written by Garima Rakesh Mishra | Pune | Published:November 19, 2016 12:00 am Artistes from across the country to perform. 
For the first time, a three-day percussion festival in Pune — ‘Pakhawaj Parv’ — is bringing together women pakhawaj players from across the country. Pakhawaj has been, for years, regarded as an instrument played primarily by men. 
The event started on Friday and will go on till Sunday evening at the Sawai Gandharva Smarak. It has been organised by the city-based Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal and Dhrupad Sansthan Gurukul of Bhopal. 
Pakhawaj Parv is the brainchild of Akhilesh Gundecha of the famous Gundecha Brothers, the leading Dagarwani Dhrupad singers from Bhopal. 
Watch What Else Is making News 
“For years, it was believed that pakhawaj can be played only by men. But it is not written anywhere; even the sangeet natya shastra doesn’t say so. I personally believe that there is nothing in this world that can be done only by men or by women. Everyone is capable of doing anything. And playing pakhawaj is an art that can be learned and developed,” said Gundecha, pakhawaj guru and trustee of Dhrupad Sansthan Bhopal. 
The musician said that for many years, it was a popular belief that the Dhrupad style of singing was meant only for male singers. 
In 2004, the Gundecha Brothers established Dhrupad Sansthan Bhopal, where they have trained 10 woman Dhrupad singers until now. 
“People say that playing a pakhawaj requires a lot of energy and hence only men can play it. On one hand, we call women a symbol of ‘shakti’ (power) and on the other, we doubt their capabilities,” said Gundecha. 
Chitrangana Agle-Reshwal (42) from Indore, one of the senior-most woman pakhawaj players in the country, shared that she is the fifth generation artiste in the family to play the instrument. 
“My father, who himself was an accomplished pakhawaj player, had taught the pakhawaj to my elder brother. While my younger brother underwent training in harmonium, I learnt kathak. I used to perform kathak on the ‘bols’ of pakhawaj, played by my brother. I always found myself attracted towards the sound of pakhawaj. When I asked my father to teach me how to play the instrument, he refused, saying ‘ye ladkiyaan nahi bajati’ (it is not played by girls),” she says, adding that she started playing the instrument on her own without her father’s knowledge. 
One day, when he heard her playing the instrument, he thought it was her elder brother doing ‘riyaz’. Pleasantly surprised, her father told her, “if you are playing so well without any training, how good will you be with formal training”. That’s when she started learning the pakhawaj from her father, 33 years ago. 
In the family of Anuja Borude, another pakhawaj player, she was the first one to learn the instrument. “My father used to perform in kirtans and that’s where my fascination for the instrument began. My guru also discouraged me initially. My father allowed me to learn pakhawaj, assuming I will give it up after a while. But I continued learning the instrument,” says 20-year-old Borude, who began playing the pakhawaj when she was eight years old. 
The pakhawaj players at the festival include Shreya Bhilare, Tanuja Ghadigaonkar, Mahima Upadhyay, Chitrangana Agle-Reshwal, Prerana Munde, Gargi Shejwal and Anuja Borude. They will be accompanied on sarangi by Ustad Farookh Latif Khan. The festival will also feature a lecture-and-demonstration — ‘Samvaad’ — on its last day. 
Renowned dhrupad duo Pandit Ramakant and Pandit Umakant Gundecha and noted khyal vocalist Shrinivas Joshi will present a duet concert of dhrupad and khyal styles of Indian classical singing. They will also discuss the similarities and contrasts between these two styles. Best of Express ",0,training

Here we see the inadequacy of Indonesian facilities, brutality, and rise of Islamic Voodoo medicine, which proponents say treats the spirit, not the mind. But what else would you expect from a people who probably were inbred themselves?

Nicolai Sennels is a Danish psychologist who has done extensive research into a little-known problem in the Muslim world: the disastrous consequences of Muslim inbreeding brought about by the marriage of first-cousins. This practice of inbreeding will never go away in the Muslim world since Muhammad is the ultimate example and authority on all matters, including marriage. The massive inbreeding in Muslim culture may well have done virtually irreversible damage to the Muslim gene pool, including extensive damage to its intelligence, sanity, and health. According to Sennels, close to half of all Muslims in the world are inbred. In Pakistan, the numbers approach 70%.

Written by Manoj Kumar R | Bengaluru | Updated: November 19, 2016 3:40 pm Ramya was heckled during her visit to a farmer’s market in Mandya 
Actor and politician Ramya was heckled by a group of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s supporters in Mandya on Friday. The incident took place when Ramya was on a visit to a farmer’s market for speaking to the sellers about the impact of demonetisation. She wanted to know how the government’s decision to discontinue Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes to introduce new currency notes was treating them. However, the exercise backfired after a group of people raised pro-Modi slogans even as they dismissed her visit as a political stunt. 
The video of Modi supporters protesting against Ramya’s visit has gone viral on social media. In the footage, demonstrators can be heard telling Ramya that people in the market were not facing any problem due to the demonetisation as they shouted pro-Modi slogans. Many even questioned her as to why she didn’t visit Mandya during the recent Cauvery water dispute.

BETHESDA, Md. — One of the most invaluable facets of basketball — and sports in general — is its ability to bring people together, no matter the circumstance, no matter the situation.
On Wednesday, basketball did just that.
In recognition of Warrior Care Month and as an early celebration for Veterans Day, the NBA sponsored a wheelchair basketball game at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center — one of the nation's largest and most renowned military hospitals in the country.

""The degree to which (the NBA has) stretched it beyond just a recognition and celebration of military service into programs and initiatives that both try to develop youth in America, not just with basketball skills but also with values, and one of those values is an appreciation for the role of the military in democratic society,"" retired Gen. Martin E. Dempsey said in a phone interview with USA TODAY Sports.
Other programs and initiatives that took place during the week included:
Indiana Pacers' CJ Miles joined volunteers to prepare 500 care packages to be sent to troops from Indiana, stationed both domestically and abroad. A handful of teams held in-arena military appreciation nights and hosted family members from the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors . Players wore Hoops for Troops shooting shirts and socks to honor members of the military. The Milwaukee Bucks held a Battle of the Badges full-court basketball game at their home arena, the BMO Harris Bradley Center. Miami Heat forward Udonis Haslem bought season tickets for the family of a fallen service member.
But despite the NBA continuing to lay the groundwork for professional sports league/military relations, Dempsey — who recently retired after 41 years of military service and now serves a special adviser to NBA commissioner Adam Silver — says there's always room for improvement.

""I'm never satisfied with where we are,"" Dempsey said.

He's always trying to understand what's going well, what's not going well, where can we learn, where can we reinforce success, and where can we adapt to make ourselves even better.""
""When this week rolls around it's a great source of pride for me that I've been able to become part of it,"" Dempsey continued. ""But I'm always asking myself and others ... how do we stay better connected with America? It's not an exaggeration to say that it's one of those times in our history where we really need to find ways in our society to pull ourselves together, not pull ourselves apart.""

10338,"SYDNEY (AP) — Substitute David Carney scored twice as Sydney FC rallied to beat the Melbourne Victory 2-1 and extend its perfect start in the A-League to five matches on Saturday.
Former Australia winger Carney came off the bench in the 60th minute to first cancel out Mitch Austin's opening goal for Melbourne, then to strike the winner in the 78th, leaving Sydney atop the table after five rounds.
Brisbane moved into second place on Friday by beating Melbourne City 1-0, and Perth might also leapfrog third-place City if it can top Western Sydney on Sunday.
Earlier Saturday, Wellington ended its winless start to the season with a 2-0 home win over Newcastle.
Adelaide United also remained winless after five matches in its defense of the A-League title when it gave up an early lead to lose 2-1 to Central Coast.
Sydney broke a nine-match losing streak against the Victory with Saturday's home win in a match of some controversy. Video replays suggested an accidental handball by Carney in the leadup to the first of his two goals, though the offense was unnoticed by officials or by Melbourne players.
Austin's goal before halftime was the first Sydney has conceded this season - they have scored 13 - but Melbourne missed many chances, including a penalty by striker Besart Berisha.
Carney took his first goal from an Alex Brosque cross, and his second after clever interplay with Rhyan Grant.
""In the first half we rode our luck,"" Sydney coach Graham Arnold said. ""They missed a penalty and (Marco) Rojas missed a great chance.
""We didn't play our way in the first half. We got too involved in the fight and in trying to get in behind them. I said to the boys at halftime I'd rather lose playing our way which is possession-based, moving the ball from side to side and waiting for the chances to come. In the second half I thought we did exceptionally well.""
Melbourne coach Kevin Muscat said his team should have been ""two or three"" goals up at halftime.
""When you're away from home and don't take your chances it gives them a chance to regroup,"" he said. ""We didn't get reward enough on the scoreboard for our movement and good play.""
Jamie MacLaren scored in the 11th minute and Brisbane held on to beat Melbourne City 1-0 for its third straight win. Brisbane is also unbeaten in its last 10 matches at home. City had long spells in possession but failed to record a single shot on goal.

8925,"PH out to re-establish ABL dominance with Alab Pilipinas   05:48 PM 
Share — Normie Riego (@riegogogo) November 14, 2016 
  The Philippines will try to establish its claim as Southeast Asia's premier basketball nation in the ASEAN Basketball League (ABL) with a new team Alab Pilipinas, which was presented to the media on Monday. 
The Philippines won twice in the first five seasons of the regional league, including the inaugural season in 2009 that was ruled by the Philippine Patriots, and again in 2013 when the San Miguel Beermen triumphed. 
The new team, Alab Pilipinas, will be coached by former De La Salle University Green Archer Ronald Cuan, and aims to be a symbol of hope and inspiration – a representation of the Filipinos'""never say die"" attitude. 
""This will be a fighting team with a big heart, very true to the Philippine brand of basketball of speed, accuracy from the outside and inside, team chemistry, and brick-wall defense, not to mention the individual talent of Filipinos in the sport,"" said Cuan. 
Cuan joined La Salle in 1997, and was part of the teams that won the UAAP championships from 1998 to 2000. He also played for the Welcoat Paint Masters in the now-defunct Philippine Basketball League, and was drafted by the Sta. Lucia Realtors in the PBA. 
""The ABL is an established league that features the best in the ASEAN region, and it would be very healthy for Philippine basketball to continue making a strong presence there,"" said Cuan. 
The team will be composed of Val Acuna, Robby Celiz, Jeric Fortuna, Paulo Hubalde, Anthony Gavieres, Igee King, Jens Knuttel, Jovet Mendoza, and JR Cawaling. Fil-Am Lawrence Domingo, a 6-foot-5 forward from Eastern New Mexico University, will also be in the roster. 
The final Filipino member of the line-up, as well as the two World imports, will be announced soon. 
Team Alab Pilipinas is organized by sports talent management Virtual Playground, headed by chief executive Charlie Dy. 
Team Alab Pilipinas is one of three new teams joining the new season of the ABL, along with Taiwan and Hong Kong. They will battle returning teams from Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam. 
The team's games will be aired live on ABS-CBN Sports+Action starting November.

5780,"John Abraham And Sonakshi Sinha Explain How Force 2 Has Some Never-Seen-Before Action 
Atletico captain Gabi singled out Modric, and not the prolific Portuguese forward, as Real’s danger man. 
“With the return of Modric they recover their best player, the man who gives them balance and really makes them play,” said the midfielder. 
“It’s a huge boost for them, and we’ll have to try and cope with him and counteract him.” 
Atletico know all about the damage Modric can cause, for it was the Croatian’s cross from a corner which led to Sergio Ramos heading in the 93rd-minute equaliser in the 2014 Champions League final, paving the way for Real’s 4-1 win in extra-time. 
Even Zinedine Zidane, one of the greatest players of all time, has admitted to being awe struck when watching Modric grace the field. 
“The things he does with the outside of his foot, those passes amaze me,” said the Real coach. 
“He can do all the things that a central midfielder has to be able to do,” said former Real boss Carlo Ancelotti. 
“But perhaps the most important thing is penetration with the ball. He has that pass that opens up the opposition.” 
Even though they have developed into a more attractive team and become more open this season, piercing Atletico’s back line remains a challenging task, with Diego Simeone’s side conceding only nine goals in 15 games in all competitions. 
Yet even without his usual midfield escorts by his side, Real are well aware Modric holds the key to unlocking Atletico and ending their three-year derby drought. Ind vs Eng",0,training

1145,"SYRIA, Va. – Residents of Syria, a small town along Virginia’s Old Blue Ridge Turnpike, got an unexpected taste of Obama’s drone war this weekend when five U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drones experienced a network glitch that caused their GPS and targeting systems to malfunction. The drones, each carrying a full payload and preprogrammed with a mission package and targeting data, were headed to Joint Base Andrews in Prince George’s County, Maryland for deployment to the Middle East.

Meanwhile, Ed and Maude Hackell arrived at the U.S. Post Office on Old Blue Ridge Turnpike early Saturday morning to mail a card to their eleven year-old grandson in Des Moines, Iowa. “Every month we send him a little money for his college fund,” Maude later told WRLH-TV, Richmond’s Fox affiliate. While Maude waited in the couple’s Buick, Ed went into the Post Office to buy a stamp. “He was only in there for a minute or two,” Maude said, wiping tears from her eyes. The elderly woman described feeling overwhelming heat and seeing a blinding flash before she lost consciousness.

When she came to, Maude found herself bleeding from a head wound and trapped inside her overturned Buick which had been thrown more than a hundred yards from the post office parking lot. The post office itself, along with Ed and thirteen other patrons, was completely obliterated when a 500 pound GBU-38 “smart” bomb, known as a JDAM or Joint Direct Attack Munition, struck the facility. At the same time, vacationers staying at the Graves Mountain Lodge, located no more than half a mile from the Post Office, were desperately searching the rubble for signs of life after at least two AGM-88 HARM tactical air-to-surface missiles hit the family owned retreat.

William Buckley, a sixty-four year-old electrician, was driving south on Route 670 towards Rose River Farm when he spotted two Reaper drones flying low over Rose River. “At first sight I thought they were RC airplanes,” Buckley said. But then the unimaginable happened. The drones fired a volley of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles into the farm, destroying at least a dozen structures including several cabins, and killing sixty-three people. “It was death from above,” Buckley said.

In all, one hundred and ninety-three people, seventy-eight of them children, were killed in the drone strikes Saturday. The Department of Defense declared the event a “national security incident” and FEMA, while preventing media access to the town, has since taken over recovery efforts.

Pentagon officials declined to comment on the incident citing national security concerns, but a defense official with knowledge of the drone program, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Washington Post that, rather than a hardware malfunction, the tragedy may have been the result of human error. “From above, the terrain is very similar to what we’re used to overseas,” the official said, adding that many of the structures appeared “run-down” or dilapidated.

Last Thursday the United States conducted its first successful drone strike against the Islamic State in Syria from the Incirlik joint air base near Adana, Turkey. Historically, only reconnaissance missions were flown out of Incirlik but earlier this month Turkey formally agreed to allow U.S. and other coalition fighter aircraft access to their bases.",1,training
6593,"I tried to tell you. “Egypt to withdraw Israel envoy over Sinai shootings,” from the BBC, August 20 (thanks to all who sent this in):

Egypt says it will withdraw its ambassador to Israel in protest at the deaths of five policemen, reportedly shot by Israeli forces on Thursday.

Cairo said it held Israel politically and legally responsible, and demanded an investigation and an apology.

Israel has promised to investigate the deaths, amid claims that Israeli forces killed the officers while chasing suspected Palestinian militants.

It is the first time in a decade that Egypt has withdrawn its ambassador.

The BBC’s Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says it marks a sharp escalation in tensions between Israel and Egypt.

The 30-year-old peace treaty was already being tested after the long-time Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak, was forced from office earlier this year, our correspondent says.

‘Erosion of order’

The latest violence began on Thursday when gunmen attacked buses near the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat, killing eight people.

Egyptian officials say Israeli forces chased the suspected militants across the border, and a number of people were killed – including the policemen.

Hundreds of Egyptians protested outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo overnight, burning the Israeli flag and demanding that the Israeli ambassador be expelled from the country. Protests were reportedly continuing on Saturday morning.

As the numbers of protesters grew outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo, the chants grew louder.

Protesters called for the embassy to be closed and the ambassador expelled. They burned the Israeli flag and tore down the metal barriers at the entrance of the embassy.

Some protesters carried pictures of the late Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, known for his open anti-Israeli stance.

Such scenes were unheard-of during the Mubarak era.

Security is tight around the embassy, two military vehicles could be seen in front of the building, and armoured emergency vehicles were also at the scene.

“We don’t want any ties with Israel,” one protester, Ahmed Aggoura, told the BBC.

“Israel is only interested in a subservient Egypt, not a free Egypt. By protesting outside the embassy we’re sending them a clear message. This is not Mubarak’s Egypt anymore. If you kill our soldiers, there will be consequences.”

On Friday, in Egypt’s second city, Alexandria, a protester managed to take down the Israeli flag from the consulate there and replaced it with Egyptian and Palestinian flags.

After the initial Eilat attack, Israel expressed concern about security in the Sinai Peninsula and said Palestinian attackers had reached Eilat after entering Egypt from Gaza and travelling through the Sinai desert.

But the Egyptian cabinet issued a statement on Saturday denying it had lost control of the Sinai and demanding an apology from the Israeli leadership over “the sad and hasty remarks about Egypt”.

“The Egyptian ambassador to Israel will be withdrawn until we are notified about the results of an investigation by the Israeli authorities,” said the statement.

Cairo said it regarded the attack as a breach of the 1979 peace treaty between the two nations, and blamed Israel for lax border controls.

Under Mr Mubarak, ties between the two nations had been stable after a history of conflict.

But Mr Mubarak’s ousting in a popular uprising has sparked fears among Israeli officials that a less amenable government could take charge in Cairo.

And correspondents say the Sinai desert region of Egypt has become increasingly lawless since Mr Mubarak was ousted, with a rise in militant activity inspired by al-Qaeda….",1,training

Redstone trial is set to begin: For the last five months, the ailing media mogul Sumner M. Redstone has been the subject of a salacious legal battle over his mental capacity. On Friday, a public trial is scheduled to begin. The suit was filed in November by Manuela Herzer [a Jewess from Argentiana — Ed.], a former companion to Mr. Redstone. [Such creatures used to be called mistresses.] Ms. Herzer claims that Mr. Redst one, 92, was not mentally competent in October when he removed her from a directive that would have given her supervision over his health decisions. On the same day, Mr. Redstone removed Ms. Herzer from his personal estate, in which he had planned to leave her $$50 million and his Los Angeles mansion, valued at $$20 million.

Ms. Herzer has said that she has fought the legal battle out of love for Mr. Redstone and that she is concerned for his well-being. Lawyers for Mr. Redstone have called the suit meritless and have said that she is after his money.

While the courtroom drama concerns Mr. Redstone’s personal life, it could have broad implications for Viacom and CBS, the two media companies he continues to control.

A few months earlier, another Jewish mistress of Redstone’s, Sydney Holland, was evicted from the Redstone estate amid dueling lawsuits that were eventually settled for an undisclosed amount. Holland and Herzer shared Redstone’s affections for a time. A former driver for Redstone has published an article which detailed Holland’s effective control of Redstone and his money, which persisted until Redstone’s partially-estanged family intervened.

4941,"People around the world were gripped by the grim drama of Troy Davis’s execution by authorities in Georgia, after the state clemency board brushed aside grave doubts about his murder conviction and the U.S. Supreme Court rebuffed his final appeal. American peace activist David Swanson followed the ups and downs of those final hours.

By David Swanson

Wednesday evening, when the news was mistakenly announced that Troy Davis would not be killed, the crowd that I was with erupted with joy and with the enthusiastic realization that we all were capable of believing that something good had been done by our government.

I was at the dedication of the Howard Zinn room in the new Busboys and Poets restaurant in Hyattsville, Maryland.

Some of us had been assigned to read selections from the late Zinn’s “Voices of a People’s History of the United States.” I was asked to read John Brown’s courtroom speech in which he said:

“Now if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children, and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit: so let it be done!”

Brown had used violence. I condemn it. Brown was not submitting. He’d been captured. But he also said this:

“[H]ad I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, sister, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right, and every man in this Court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment.”

Had Troy Davis been able to afford an expensive lawyer. Had Troy Davis been white. Had Troy Davis lived in a different state or a different nation.

Davis was again told he would be killed. He was again told that he might not be. He was again told that he would be killed. And finally, he was killed by chemical injection while strapped down to prevent writhing.

Observers observed. And those of us who had left the restaurant to go and protest in front of the U.S. Supreme Court wailed in pain, while the world reacted as it reacted to the killing of Sacco and Vanzetti, and as it has reacted to each of our governments’ million acts of barbarism down through the years.

Over in Texas another man was governmentally killed, thus creating the possibility for even louder applause when that state’s governor’s total scalp-count is next announced.

Meanwhile, large numbers of people are killed in our wars, wars our President announced Wednesday morning are waged on behalf of peace. Where is Amnesty International? Where is the NAACP? Are those people killed in wars less human?

What about those our government has tortured to death? Does the manner in which they are killed make them more lamentable than those killed with bombs, just as chemical injection is deemed less lamentable than electrocution?

Our government now kills, as a rule, rather than taking prisoners. And it kills with unmanned drones. It also kicks in doors at night and disappears people.

We know a little about assassination teams that have operated in Afghanistan in recent years, teams including Special Forces, CIA, and mercenaries. I have good reason to believe — although I cannot now say why — that such teams have also operated on U.S. soil.

But isn’t killing, even on Afghan soil, just as evil? Should it matter where, or who, or why, or how?

Aren’t the lost opportunities to save lives when our money all goes to wars and Wall Street just as murderous? Medicare cuts kill. Unclean air kills. Pretending Social Security is in trouble kills. Pushing our elders into the poor house kills. Polluting our environment kills.

Our government’s status as pro-life is in grave doubt. Its title as the greatest purveyor of violence in the world remains in place.

We can’t prosecute Supreme Court justices because we have no Justice Department. We can’t impeach Supreme Court justices, because we have no Congress. What can we do?

One thing that I think we can and must do is recognize that, if for that one moment we believed Troy Davis might be spared, then we believe in our hearts that victory is possible. And because we believe that, we have a responsibility to work for it.

We can do that by building as large a presence as possible to occupy Washington, D.C., beginning October 6th — http://october2011.org

5712,"Jake Ejercito: Friendship with Sandro Marcos goes 'beyond politics' ABS-CBN News Posted at Nov 09 2016 02:39 PM 
Share Facebook 
MANILA – Jake Ejercito strongly believes his friendship with Sandro Marcos will not be affected by politics. 
This after a netizen called him out for airing his opinion on the recent decision of the Supreme Court to allow the burial of Sandro’s grandfather, former president Ferdinand E. Marcos, at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. 
On Instagram, Ejercito, who is the son of former president Joseph Estrada, shared a photo of a book titled “Bayan Ko” and in the caption, he wrote: ""Body may be buried, but not the truth."" 
According to the netizen, this somehow feels “off” considering that Ejercito is Sandro's friend. 
“Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion and I respect that but it’s just that seeing you post this while hanging out once in a while with Sandro Marcos in London is kinda off… just saying,” the netizen wrote. 
Responding to the comment, Ejercito said: “Real friendships go beyond politics.” 
Back in May, Ejercito came to the defense of Sandro after he was criticized on social media for his actions and statements during the presidential elections. 
According to Ejercito, Sandro is “way better than what social media depicts him to be.” 
He also said at that time that he and Sandro have known each other for a long time.

6608,"Exclusive: A founding Russia-gate myth is that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies agreed that Russia hacked into and distributed Democratic emails, a falsehood that The New York Times has belatedly retracted, reports Robert Parry.

By Robert Parry (Updated on July 1 with new NYT deception)

The New York Times has finally admitted that one of the favorite Russia-gate canards – that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies concurred on the assessment of Russian hacking of Democratic emails – is false.

On Thursday, the Times appended a correction to a June 25 article that had repeated the false claim, which has been used by Democrats and the mainstream media for months to brush aside any doubts about the foundation of the Russia-gate scandal and portray President Trump as delusional for doubting what all 17 intelligence agencies supposedly knew to be true.

In the Times’ White House Memo of June 25, correspondent Maggie Haberman mocked Trump for “still refus[ing] to acknowledge a basic fact agreed upon by 17 American intelligence agencies that he now oversees: Russia orchestrated the attacks, and did it to help get him elected.”

However, on Thursday, the Times – while leaving most of Haberman’s ridicule of Trump in place – noted in a correction that the relevant intelligence “assessment was made by four intelligence agencies — the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. The assessment was not approved by all 17 organizations in the American intelligence community.”

The Times’ grudging correction was vindication for some Russia-gate skeptics who had questioned the claim of a full-scale intelligence assessment, which would usually take the form of a National Intelligence Estimate (or NIE), a product that seeks out the views of the entire Intelligence Community and includes dissents.

The reality of a more narrowly based Russia-gate assessment was admitted in May by President Obama’s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Obama’s CIA Director John Brennan in sworn congressional testimony.

Clapper testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on May 8 that the Russia-hacking claim came from a “special intelligence community assessment” (or ICA) produced by selected analysts from the CIA, NSA and FBI, “a coordinated product from three agencies – CIA, NSA, and the FBI – not all 17 components of the intelligence community,” the former DNI said.

Clapper further acknowledged that the analysts who produced the Jan. 6 assessment on alleged Russian hacking were “hand-picked” from the CIA, FBI and NSA.

Yet, as any intelligence expert will tell you, if you “hand-pick” the analysts, you are really hand-picking the conclusion. For instance, if the analysts were known to be hard-liners on Russia or supporters of Hillary Clinton, they could be expected to deliver the one-sided report that they did.

Politicized Intelligence

In the history of U.S. intelligence, we have seen how this selective approach has worked, such as the phony determination of the Reagan administration pinning the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II and other acts of terror on the Soviet Union.

CIA Director William Casey and Deputy Director Robert Gates shepherded the desired findings through the process by putting the assessment under the control of pliable analysts and sidelining those who objected to this politicization of intelligence.

The point of enlisting the broader intelligence community – and incorporating dissents into a final report – is to guard against such “stove-piping” of intelligence that delivers the politically desired result but ultimately distorts reality.

Another painful example of politicized intelligence was President George W. Bush’s 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq’s WMD that removed State Department and other dissents from the declassified version that was given to the public.

Since Clapper’s and Brennan’s testimony in May, the Times and other mainstream news outlets have avoided a direct contradiction of their earlier acceptance of the 17-intelligence-agencies canard by simply referring to a judgment by “the intelligence community.”

That finessing of their earlier errors has allowed Hillary Clinton and other senior Democrats to continue referencing this fictional consensus without challenge, at least in the mainstream media.

For instance, on May 31 at a technology conference in California, Clinton referred to the Jan. 6 report, asserting that “Seventeen agencies, all in agreement, which I know from my experience as a Senator and Secretary of State, is hard to get. They concluded with high confidence that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign, to influence voters in the election.”

The failure of the major news organizations to clarify this point about the 17 agencies may have contributed to Haberman’s mistake on June 25 as she simply repeated the groupthink that nearly all the Important People in Washington just knew to be true.

Even after the correction, the Times quickly returned to its pattern of deceiving its readers regarding the U.S. intelligence assessment. On June 30, a Times article reported: “Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the unanimous conclusion of United States intelligence agencies that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 race.”

The phrasing “unanimous conclusion” again suggests that all 17 intelligence agencies are in accord, albeit without specifically saying so, a journalistic sleight of hand that raises further doubts about the objectivity and honesty of the Times on this issue.

The Times’ belated correction — and its new deceptive formulation — underscore the growing sense that the U.S. mainstream media has joined in a political vendetta against Trump and has cast aside professional standards to the point of repeating false claims designed to denigrate him.

That, in turn, plays into Trump’s Twitter complaints that he and his administration are the targets of a “witch hunt” led by the “fake news” media, a grievance that appears to be energizing his supporters and could discredit whatever ongoing investigations eventually conclude.

4567,"Supreme Court upholds Obama rule making mortgage brokers eligible for overtime pay

(Yahoo/AP) – The Supreme Court has sided with the Obama administration in upholding a rule making mortgage brokers eligible for overtime pay under federal labor law.

The justices unanimously agreed Monday to throw out a lower court ruling that faulted the administration for trying to change overtime rules without following proper procedures.

FAX BLAST SPECIAL: Impeach Obama NOW!

The case turned on rules put in place by the Department of Labor that would make the mortgage brokers eligible for overtime pay under federal labor law. The rules were changed twice in a four-year period that spanned the Bush and Obama administrations.

In 2006, the Labor Department said the mortgage brokers were like executives and thus not covered by the overtime provision. In 2010, the department reversed itself.

9091,"Hillary Clinton beats Donald Trump 4-2 in Dixville Notch, N.H., midnight voting   12:12 a.m. EST November 8, 2016 Share Nervous? Here is what to expect tomorrow. USA TODAY 
As the world waits with bated breath for the results of Tuesday's contentious presidential election, its eyes turned briefly to three sleepy hamlets in rural New Hampshire, as their residents — less than 100 total — became the first in the nation to cast their ballots. 
In Dixville Notch, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump four votes to two. 
According to New Hampshire law, communities with less than 100 voters can open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. 
The best known of these three towns, Dixville Notch has been voting at midnight every election since 1960. Neil Tillotson, the former owner of the Balsams Grant Resort Hotel, which closed in 2011, started midnight voting in Dixville in 1960 to stir up publicity for the resort. Almost all of the Dixville voters are employees of the resort . 
This could be Dixville's last year in the election spotlight, however. Les Otten, a New England businessman, bought the Balsams and plans to redevelop it into a massive ski resort. That could bring the population in Dixville over 100 people, thereby ending its midnight voting tradition. 
Hart's Location was the first town to begin the tradition of early voting in 1948. According to the town's website, it started when the town was ""inhabited mostly by Maine Central Railroad workers and their families"" and early voting became the most convenient way for them to vote. The practice apparently garnered too much media attention for the folks of Hart's Landing, however, and midnight voting was abandoned in 1964, ""when residents became tired of all the media ruckus and voted to end it."" 
Hart's Landing revived the practice in 1996. The town website blames the 32-year lull in midnight voting as the reason Dixville Notch gets all the attention, even though Dixville began the practice more than a decade later than Hart's Landing. 
Millsfield, located just over 12 miles down the road from Dixville Notch, is the newest town to get in on the act. Millsfield began midnight voting as early as 1952 (no one seems certain exactly when) and stopped the practice in the 1960s (again, no one seems certain exactly when). The town was invited to take the tradition back up last year by New Hampshire's secretary of State, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the New Hampshire primary. x Share When each state in America closes their polling, times converted to Eastern. By Janet Loehrke and Ramon Padilla, USA TODAY. USA TODAY 
“It’s important for us to revisit history that has been forgotten by most people,” Wayne Urso, the Millsfield election official who is spearheading the midnight vote told Medill News Service. 
Don't read too much into the results from these towns. They lean conservative and normally vote Republican. Dixville voted for the Republican in every election since 1960 — including Barry Goldwater who lost in a landslide to Lyndon Johnson — until going for Obama in 2008, and splitting the vote between Romney and Obama in 2012. 
Since reviving midnight voting, Hart's Landing voted for Dole in 1996, Bush in 2000 and 2004, and Obama in 2008 and 2012. 
Dixville had predicted every Republican nominee since 1968 (counting ties in 1980 and 2012), but that streak came to a crashing halt when Donald Trump walked into town as John Kasich edged out the future nominee 3-2. Facebook Posted!  ",0,training
